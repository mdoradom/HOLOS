Goals
=========
- Evaluate the performance of a code (execution time, cycles)
- Detect the memory access pattern of a code
- Understand the impact of the cache in a code
- Basic use of functions to manage dynamic memory
- Use of the GPU


Directory structure
========================
In the supplied code the following directories are found each with the source
code required for the following sections:

- 1_matrix (Performance Evaluation)
- 2_access_pattern (Access pattern)
- 3_dynamic_memory (Dynamic Memory)
- tools (Utilities to measure time and analysis)


Performance Evaluation
======================
It is important to know how to evaluate the performance of our codes. Know how
much time our code takes. In our context (video games) it is imperative
since this defines the performance of our games, the number of frames that
I can show per second. The less time it takes to "calculate" a frame, more frames
I could generate.

Measuring the time it takes to execute a a piece of code is relatively simple
if I have a function _captureTime_ that works as a stopwatch:

```
	...
	t1 = captureTime();

	// code to measure

	t2 = captureTime();
	temps = t2 - t1; //Time it takes to execute the code
	...
```

The only problem is that the resolution and cost of this _captureTime_ depends
of the hardware and the operating system used. In the case of Windows (TM), its
documentation gives us a pretty detailed explanation [[TIME]].

To give you an idea, in the _measure.c_ file, you will find the routines
_start_counter_ and _get_counter_ which basically serve as a stopwatch,
returning the number of microseconds that have passed between the two calls.
These routines work both on Windows and on Linux.

An additional problem is that the time it takes to execute a certain code is
not always exactly the same due to the complexity of the factors involved
nowadays. The code to be measured does not run directly on the architecture,
but rather there is an operating system, and devices that interrupt the usual flow
of execution, ... therefore, what we usually do is run the same code
several times and do a statistical analysis of the results to get
a value that is more or less stable.
The _measure_full_ routine, found in _measure.c_ file, automates this process and
return the minimum execution time of a code. In particular, it runs the code
several times, measuring their run times and keeping these values until the
difference in time between the smaller values is less than 1 percent
(1% or 0.01), which is the factor that we have decided to consider a measure
of time stable enough. This routine will be used in the following exercises.


Evaluating arrays ...
-------------------
To begin with we are going to evaluate a very simple code of matrix traversals.
We want to see if it takes the same time to traverse a matrix by rows or by columns.
We will see that for small matrixes, both traversals are similar, but for
bigger matrixes... this is not true any more.

In _matriu.c_ file you have a code that traverses a very small array (4x4).
The code shows how long it takes in microseconds to traverse the matrix by rows and by
columns. The shown time is the smallest after executing up to 10 times the same code,
evaluating that the error between the 3 lowest values is smaller than 1% (0.01).

For the evaluation, compile and execute the application, write
down the time it takes for each traversal, increase the matrix rows and columns sizes
(using the same value for both) using powers of 2 (8, 16, 32, ...), and repeat.

- Make a table with the size of the array and the execution times for both
traversals.

- Is the execution time similar when you the matrix is traversed by rows than
when it is traversed by columns? (Repeat a couple of executions to be sure)

- After evaluating the results, what can you extract from it? Is there
any change in the execution times for both traversals? How much does
it occupy 1 row? Why do you think it happens?

- Compare the cache levels of your processor [[CPUDB]] with the results
that you get in the table.


Access patterns and impact of the cache
---------------------------------------
The structures we use to store information (such as arrays) should be
linearized to saved them to memory (as we saw in theory). And therefore the
pattern used to access these structures affects performance (as we have seen in
the previous section). Let's see exactly how.

In the following exercise we present 3 programs: _mm-ijk.c, mm-jki.c and mm-kij.c_.
They correspond to 3 of the 6 forms ijk of the product of matrices. For example, in the
_mm-ijk.c_ program the next portion of code is measured (ijk means that the
more external loop is the loop controlled by the variable 'i' and the more
internal one is controlled by 'k'):

```
	for (i=0; i<N; i++)
		for (j=0; j<N; j++)
			for (k=0; k<N; k++)
				C[i][j] = C[i][j] + A[i][k] * B[k][j];
```

The 3 programs perform, in a different way, the same operation: the product
of matrices: C = A * B.

There is a macro that defines the size of the arrays, by default of 256x256 floats:
```
	#ifndef N
	#define N 256  /* Default dimension */
	#endif
```
If this size is N = 6 (or smaller), it shows the contents of the resulting array
C, so you can check that the 3 programs do exactly the same.
If it is larger, it only makes the product and returns the runtime in milliseconds.

For the following exercises, choose one of the cases.

- It is important to know the access pattern to memory of a code. For example
  in the previous code, matrix C is accessed through C[i][j] and due to the
  order of the 'i' and 'j' loops, the following elements are accessed in order:
```
        C[0][0], C[0][1], C[0][2], ... C[0][N],
        C[1][0], C[1][1], C[1][2], ... C[1][N],
        ...
```
Therefore, all the elements from the first row are accessed, then all from the
second and so on.

Draw, for the chosen case, the order in which the matrices A, B and C are traversed
(the order in which the first matrix is traversed is included in the drawing
for reference):

- Write down the execution time of the chosen version:
```
		   | Temps execuci√≥ (en ms)
		 N | mm-ijk | mm-jki | mm-kij
	-------+--------+--------+--------
	   256 |        |        |
	   512 |        |        |
	  1024 |        |        |
```


- Assuming that each element in the array occupies 4 bytes, and that the size
of our system's page is 4Kbytes, calculate for the chosen case the number
of virtual memory pages that are used when completely executing the most
internal loop 1 time.
For example, in the mm-ijk case, at each execution of the 'k' loop 'C' matrix
access a single element (4 bytes), while the 'A' matrix accesses a whole row
(consecutive elements) and 'B' matrix accesses a whole column (non-consecutive
elements).

```

	   512 |          |          |          |
	  1024 |          |          |          |
	-------+----------+----------+----------+

	  1024 |          |          |          |

	  1024 |          |          |          |
	-------+----------+----------+----------+
```

Dynamic memory
================
The _malloc_ and _free_ routines from the C library allow a user program to
request dynamic memory to the operating system. The operating system assigns
new space to the process, but because the granularity of the call (that requests
bytes) and the granularity of the OS (reserves and maps pages of 4096 bytes) do not
match, it may happen that the user can execute non-legal code .

The _mem.c_ file contains a code that reserves an array of 10 characters and
initializes its positions. Then try to access positions outside of this
array.

- Run the code, observe the result and try to deduce what is happening.

The _mem2.c_ file shows the pernicious effects of using memory that we have
not explicitly reserved.

- Run the code, observe the result and try to deduce what is happening.

GPU fun
=======
Nowadays, although the cache is important, in the context of video games, the
workload is carried out by the GPU and therefore it is even more important.
At [[GPU]] Keith O'Conor (coder and CTO of [Romero Games]) gives a very good
explanation of the importance of GPUs (and enough references to be entertained
for a looong time).
